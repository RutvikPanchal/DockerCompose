## Development Notes
<br/>

```
1.) Docker uses the name of the parent directory of docker-compose.yaml as the name of compose project

2.) Use the Docker Desktop app to see all the set environment variables. It's located under Pod > Inspect Tab
    - It probably uses printenv to get a list of all the set environment variables
